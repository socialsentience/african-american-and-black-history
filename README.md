# African Americans Building America: From Emancipation to the Rise of White Supremacist Violence

The period between the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan represents a critical chapter in American history, marking both tremendous progress and devastating setbacks for African Americans. During this transformative era, formerly enslaved individuals and free Black Americans made extraordinary contributions to the nation's physical infrastructure, political system, educational institutions, and military strength, even as they faced mounting resistance. Their story reveals both the promise of freedom and the persistent forces that sought to limit it, highlighting a complex legacy that continues to shape American society today.

## The Dawn of Freedom and Its Immediate Aftermath

The Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 marked the official beginning of freedom for enslaved African Americans in the Confederacy, although many did not hear of it for several months[5]. This watershed moment changed the nature of the Civil War, transforming it from a conflict solely about preserving the Union to one that explicitly aimed to end slavery. The Proclamation encouraged many enslaved individuals to escape toward Union lines, where many joined the Union Army[8]. However, initially, it only freed slaves in areas still in rebellion, meaning those in Union-controlled territories and Border States remained in bondage until the passage of the 13th Amendment in 1865, which formally abolished slavery throughout the United States[9].

Freedom came during a time of great national disruption, with the country facing the monumental task of reconstruction following the devastation of the Civil War[5]. For newly freed African Americans, emancipation represented not just an end to bondage but the beginning of a journey toward full citizenship and equality. This period saw African Americans eagerly seeking opportunities that had long been denied them: formal education, political representation, economic independence, and family reunification. Their aspirations and actions would help reshape the nation in profound ways, even as they encountered fierce opposition.

## Building the Physical Infrastructure of America

African Americans had long contributed to constructing America's most iconic buildings, even before emancipation. Enslaved African Americans were involved in every aspect of the construction of the White House, including clearing the land, transporting building materials, carpentry, and bricklaying[1]. Records from the National Archives show over 120 names of people listed as "Negro hire" who worked with white laborers from the United States and Europe, though the slave owners, rather than the slaves themselves, were paid for their work[1].

Beyond the White House, enslaved African Americans mined sandstone from local quarries and built the United States Capitol and the Smithsonian Castle[7]. In a profound irony, Congress, the institution that guarded the people's freedom, held sessions in a building constructed by forced labor, and legislators would have witnessed lines of shackled African Americans marching by daily en route to the Deep South[7]. After emancipation, freed African Americans continued to contribute to the nation's physical development, applying their skills in construction, agriculture, and various trades to the growth of communities across the country.

## Military Service and Sacrifice

When the Civil War broke out in 1861, African Americans were ready to join the fight, though they were initially rejected from the Union army for fear of alienating pro-slavery sympathizers in the North and Border States[5]. As the war progressed, however, this position changed, and both free Northern African Americans and escaped Southerners were permitted to enlist. By the end of the four-year conflict, more than 186,000 African American soldiers had served, constituting approximately 10 percent of the Union army[5]. 

These soldiers made significant sacrifices for the cause of freedom, with more than 38,000 losing their lives[5]. Their bravery was recognized with 21 soldiers receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor, including Sergeant Major Christian Fleetwood[5]. The contributions of these African American soldiers proved essential to the Union's victory, as Confederate General Robert E. Lee acknowledged when he observed that the Emancipation Proclamation gave the Union access to vastly increased forces, making it "imperative for the Confederacy to increase its own numbers"[8].

## Political Participation and the Expansion of Democracy

In the years following the Civil War, African Americans achieved unprecedented political involvement, with the Reconstruction Acts of 1867-1868 and the 15th Amendment (1870) extending suffrage to Black men[9]. This represented one of Reconstruction's greatest successes, as African American men not only voted but also ran for and were elected to offices at local, state, and federal levels[11]. These elected officials played crucial roles in creating public schools for both blacks and whites in Southern and border states[3].

African American political participation faced fierce opposition from white supremacists. Conservative whites, frustrated with their political failures during 1867, began looking for ways to defeat their Republican opponents and control the recently enfranchised freedpeople[13]. The Ku Klux Klan and similar organizations emerged partly in response to this Black political engagement, targeting politically active African Americans and their white allies[4][6]. Despite this violent opposition, African American voters and elected officials managed to implement progressive policies that benefited all citizens during this brief period of democratic expansion.

## Education and the Pursuit of Knowledge

After emancipation, African Americans eagerly sought educational opportunities that had been systematically denied to them under slavery[3]. Learning to read became a powerful symbol of freedom, while education also represented practical preparation for economic advancement and civic participation[3]. Many hoped that education would both improve their economic circumstances and offer some protection from fraud and exploitation in their new lives as free people[3].

Creating educational institutions faced significant challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers. In many communities, the small number of literate African Americans shared their knowledge with family members, friends, and neighbors[3]. In Sharpsburg, Maryland, a small church known as Tolson's Chapel served as both a religious center and a school for African Americans between 1868 and 1899[3]. The history of schools like the one housed in Tolson's Chapel illustrates how African Americans across the former slave-holding states created and sustained educational institutions during Reconstruction, often with limited resources but extraordinary determination.

## Economic Transformations and Labor Challenges

The Civil War fundamentally transformed Southern labor relations[6]. Formerly enslaved people fled plantations, took up arms against their exploiters, and began to forge new economic horizons. For plantation owners, this transformation represented a financial disaster as the laborers they had held in bondage staged what W.E.B. Du Bois later called a "general strike," leaving them economically vulnerable[6].

In the aftermath of emancipation, various systems emerged to organize agricultural labor, including sharecropping. Under this arrangement, Black workers farmed the land of white planters and were supposed to earn an equitable share of the profits. In practice, however, many were exploited, accruing insurmountable debts to the landowners whose fields they worked[11]. Meanwhile, apprenticeship laws, by which whites could win custody of Black children and put them to work, functioned as an alternative form of enslavement[11]. Despite these challenges, many African Americans sought and sometimes achieved economic independence, establishing their own farms, businesses, and professional practices in the years following emancipation.

## The Rise of the Ku Klux Klan: Violent Opposition to Progress

The secret society known as the Ku Klux Klan was founded by a group of Confederate veterans in Pulaski, Tennessee, on December 24, 1865â€”less than a month after the ratification of the 13th Amendment[12]. The organization's first Grand Wizard was Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, who reportedly expressed approval of the group's secrecy and goals, stating: "That's a good thing; that's a damned good thing. We can use that to keep the niggers in their place"[6].

The KKK functioned as a loosely organized group of political and social terrorists whose objectives included overturning Reconstruction legislation, returning white majority rule to the former Confederate states, denying Black freedom and rights, and securing the political defeat of the Republican Party[12][13]. In February and March 1868, General Forrest visited Atlanta several times and met with prominent Georgia conservatives, likely helping to organize a statewide Klan structure. By summer 1868, the Klan was widespread across Georgia[13].

Klan violence specifically targeted African Americans who sought to exercise their newfound rights. Masked men shot into houses and burned them, sometimes with the occupants still inside, and drove successful Black farmers off their land[4]. According to contemporary reports, in North and South Carolina alone, during an 18-month period ending in June 1867, there were 197 murders and 548 cases of aggravated assault attributed to white supremacist violence[4]. Klan violence was particularly intense during election seasons, with more than 2,000 people killed, wounded, or otherwise injured in Louisiana within a few weeks prior to the Presidential election of November 1868[4].

## The Struggle for Rights Amid Growing Resistance

As Reconstruction progressed, African Americans and their allies made significant strides in extending rights and citizenship to formerly enslaved individuals. The 14th Amendment (1868) extended citizenship to all persons born in the United States and reaffirmed equal protection of the laws to all citizens, while the 15th Amendment (1870) protected the right to vote regardless of race[9]. These constitutional amendments represented essential steps toward establishing legal equality for African Americans.

However, the achievements of Reconstruction faced mounting opposition. In addition to the Ku Klux Klan, other white supremacist organizations emerged, including the White League in Louisiana and the Red Shirts in Mississippi and the Carolinas[4]. These groups employed violence and intimidation to suppress Republican voting and drive Republicans from office[4]. Congress responded to this terrorism by passing the Enforcement Acts in 1870 and 1871, which were intended to prosecute and suppress Klan crimes[4]. While these federal efforts temporarily weakened the Klan, white supremacist violence continued in various forms.

## Conclusion: A Legacy of Achievement and Resistance

The period between the Emancipation Proclamation and the entrenchment of the Ku Klux Klan represents a complex chapter in American history, marked by both remarkable achievements and devastating setbacks for African Americans. Despite the brutality of slavery and the subsequent violence of white supremacist organizations, African Americans made extraordinary contributions to building the United Statesâ€”physically, politically, educationally, and culturally. They served in the military, participated in democratic governance, established educational institutions, and transformed labor systems.

The legacy of this era continues to shape American society. Although many of the accomplishments of Reconstruction were reversed in subsequent decades as federal troops withdrew from the South and Jim Crow laws took hold, the constitutional amendments and precedents established during this period provided the legal foundation for later civil rights movements. The story of African Americans building America between emancipation and the rise of the KKK demonstrates both the possibility of progress and the persistent forces that have opposed it throughout American history. It is a testament to the resilience, determination, and vision of those who, even in the face of extreme adversity, worked to build a more perfect union.
